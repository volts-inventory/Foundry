# LEARNINGS — append-only compounding knowledge

**Read this FIRST before any task.** Every agent appends reusable lessons here.
Keep entries terse, root-caused, and actionable. Periodically consolidated.

## Conventions every agent must follow
- L1. `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module; full type hints.
- L2. Run the gate chain locally before reporting done: `uv run ruff check foundry tests`
  → `uv run mypy foundry` → `uv run pytest -q`. Production code (`foundry/`) must pass mypy
  strictly; test modules are exempt from the strict type bar.
- L3. Every agent I/O artifact is a **frozen pydantic v2 model** in the matching
  `foundry/schemas/*` module. Reuse existing base models (`FrozenModel`, records). Do not
  invent a parallel artifact type.
- L4. Artifacts are **content-addressed + versioned, never mutated**. Supersession, not
  in-place edit. Bodies are stored out-of-band as handles; never put bodies in state channels.
- L5. **Agents emit `GateTriage` (advisory), never `GateResult` (verdict).** Verdicts are
  computed + signed by the two-zone gate runner. Writing an unsigned `GateResult` to the
  `gates` channel is dropped by `_merge_gates` (fail-closed) — by design.
- L6. **All model calls go through `foundry/proxy/`** (single egress). Never import/call the
  Anthropic SDK directly from an agent or gate. The proxy observes the served model, stamps
  judgment provenance, and applies the determinism policy.
- L7. Idempotency keys must be **process-stable** — use `content_digest`, never Python's
  builtin `hash()` (seed-randomized per process; defeats outbox dedup on resume).
- L8. Reducers must be pure / commutative / associative / None-safe and **read** global
  cross-fork records (never write them). A LangGraph resume re-folds committed writes, so any
  non-idempotent fold is a bug the property tests will catch.

## Inefficiencies already caught (don't reintroduce — build-log.md)
- I1. No signature re-verification per reducer fold — memoize by content identity; nonce/latch
  reads are the only un-cached (mutable) inputs.
- I2. No intermediate list materialization in reducers (`(a or []) + (b or [])`); iterate both.
- I3. No full-tree re-hash per `tree_sha`; use the blob cache keyed `(path, size, mtime_ns)`.
- I4. Outbox relay drains in batches with one indexed SELECT per pass — never per-row polling.
- I5. Checkpoint carries content-addressed handles only; serde allowlists frozen Foundry models
  (no pickle fallback).

## Bugs the Phase-0 property tests caught (the gate earns its keep)
- B1. `merge_constraints` must be a pure keyed union retaining superseded records as data;
  supersession is a read-time view (`live_constraints()`), else resume re-folds resurrect data.
- B2. Judgment-binding memo cache key = `(content_identity, seq.node_id)` — content_identity
  excludes seq but the binding signs node_id; collision otherwise.
- B3. The shared checkpointer connection's `commit()` is a no-op while `superstep_txn()` is
  open (one COMMIT at superstep exit) — else the checkpoint persists without its outbox rows.

## Provider-accuracy notes (verified against the live Anthropic surface)
- P1. Tier map: `claude-opus-4-8` (T1) / `claude-sonnet-4-6` (T2) / `claude-haiku-4-5` (T3).
- P2. `temperature` is **removed on opus-4-8** (400 if sent) — the "temp 0 for gates/judges"
  policy applies only to T2/T3; on T1 record `output_config.effort` and note the substitution.
- P3. No `system_fingerprint`; served-model observation = `response.model` + `_request_id`.
- P4. Judgment verdict channel = `output_config.format` (json_schema); stable SOP prefix is
  `cache_control`-cached.

## Orchestration / tooling
- O1. mypy gate is `mypy foundry` (config in pyproject; `ignore_missing_imports=true`).
  Don't add `# type: ignore` unless needed — `warn_unused_ignores` flags dead ignores.
- O2. `make_union_by_key` is a generic *function*; mypy rejects `f[T](...)` type-application on
  functions. Type the key callable via a named function with annotated params, not a lambda.
- O3. pytest collects production classes named `Test_*` only (pyproject) — domain types like
  `TestPlan`/`TestReport` are NOT test cases. Name real test classes `Test_*` or use functions.
- O4. No CI of any kind (no `.github/workflows`). All verification is local via the gate chain.
